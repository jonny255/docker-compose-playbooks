## Description:

## Will need to be completed/To-Do List':'

[] Refactor: See if I could refactor pycryptobot. If not, look into other algo bots I could easily customize.
[] Watchdog: Regularly scan for new coins entering the market and have existed for more than 3 months.
[] Automatic movement of funds between Coinbase and bank and/or wallet.
[] Dashboard: For seeing status of entire swarm including financial updates.
[] Monitoring: Create heartbeats for each container so that the hub could restart or destroy/recreate containers as needed.
[] Create a system/process that could efficiently manage containers with hot coins (are updated every minute) vs cold coins (updated once per 15 minutes) as far as resource management
[] Dry-Runs: Be able to run simulated dry-runs experimenting with various trading models.
